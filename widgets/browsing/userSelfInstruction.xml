	ADA WIDGET CONFIGURATION XML
	============================

	This file contains the widgets configuration, it must have the same name and be in the same subdir
	(relative to the widgets dir) where the template it refers to is.
	E.g.
		If the template the page is using is: layout/THEMENAME/templates/XXX/YYY.tpl
		the widget must be in:				  widgets/XXX/YYY.xml

		If it's NOT a multiprovider environment and the following file exists:
		clients/PROVIDER_NAME/widgets/XXX/YYY.xml, it will have priority over the standard one

	every <widget> can contain the following tags:
	(*)		<field>  this is the corresponding template_field name of the template where the widget will be rendered
	(**)	<id>	 this is the id that will be assigned to the generated html div element that contains the widget
	(*)		<module> this is the name of the file inside the widgets/ajax dir that will be executed for widget rendering
			<active> this is an optional 0 or 1 value telling whether the widget is active or not
			<async>  this is an optional 0 or 1 value telling whether the widget will be loaded in async(1) or sync(0) mode
			<param>  this is used to pass parameters to the <module> file, can have name and value attributes

	(*)  : required for the widget to work properly (either sync or async mode)
	(**) : required for the widget to work in async mode

	PLS look at each <module> file you're using, it may require some required parameters to work properly
